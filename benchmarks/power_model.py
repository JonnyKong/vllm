    Computes the average power per batch based on the following rules:
    
    1. First, filter the power readings to only include rows where the GPU
    power value changes. If the time interval between readings deviates from
    100ms by more than Â±20%, a warning is printed.
    
    2. Determine whether all batch latencies are greater than 200ms. The
    latency of a batch is calculated as: `pp_rank_0_idle - pp_rank_0_start`.
    
    3. If all batches have latencies greater than 200ms, compute the average
    power per batch by:
        - Extracting all power readings recorded within the batch duration from
          `pp_rank_0_start` to `pp_rank_0_idle`.
        - Ignoring the first power reading of each batch.
        - Averaging the remaining power readings for each batch.
        - Taking the average of these per-batch power values to get the final
          result.
    
    4. If any batch has a latency shorter than 200ms:
        - Consider all power readings from the start of the first batch to the
          end of the last batch.
        - Ignore the first power reading in the first batch.
        - Compute the average power from the remaining readings.
